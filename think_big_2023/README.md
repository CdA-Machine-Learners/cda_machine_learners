# Think Big 2023

- Goals:
  * a python Flask app
  * a single discord channel that the bot responds to, so we don't get flooded in other channels.
  * Should we open the bot up to private messages?
  * I imagine Discord summons our bot via like a webhook? So we'll need to find a good tunnel/reverse proxy and plug that in
  * we can have multiple bots via having multiple endpoints, I imagine.
  * The bots:
  * /t2midjourney <prompt> is there a simple way to intercept these messages and have my paid account mirror the request? That could be cool.
  * /t2i <prompt> text 2 image, StableD
  * /i2i <url> <prompt>, img 2 img, StableD
  * /t2t <prompt>, ChatGPT
  * /t2v <prompt> some text 2 vid model, I have yet to experiment here
  * /t2langchain if anyone has any cool ideas
